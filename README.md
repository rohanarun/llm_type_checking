What if we enforce type checking at runtime in all python code, then run the errors through a local free llama model to automatically 'fix' them all and re-run the failed function. I really think things like crowdstrike would be impossible if we deeply integrated LLMs to magically resolve errors at runtime, since they can detect obvious errors between explicitly defined rules.
